# Teach Myself CS

This repository contains my learning notes as I study computer science fundamentals independently. This project focuses on what [`TYSCS`](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) and [`OSSU reading`](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/extras/readings.md) provide.

## 📚 Learning Materials

### 1. HTDP - How to Design Programs
Notes on the discipline of building systematic and well-structured programs.

**Topics Covered:**
- Systematic Program Design (SPD)
- Design Recipe: 6-step methodology for writing programs
- Iterative Refinement
- Problem analysis to data structure mapping
- Testing and documentation

📁 Source: [`htdp.org`](https://htdp.org)

### 2. SICP - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
Notes on building abstractions through procedures and fundamental programming concepts.

**Topics Covered:**
- Building Abstractions with Procedures
- Elements of Programming (primitives, combinations, abstractions)
- Homoiconic properties
- Prefix notation in Lisp/Scheme
- Programs as data

📁 Location: [`SICP pdf`](./SICP/sicp.pdf)

## 🎯 Goals

This project aims to:
- Understand computer science foundations through self-study
- Apply discipline in writing good and structured code
- Build strong computational thinking
- Document the learning process

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Design Recipe (from HTDP)
1. From problem to data analysis
2. Signature, purpose statement, header
3. Function examples
4. Function template
5. Function definitions
6. Testing

### Elements of Programming (from SICP)
1. **Primitive expressions** - basic language elements
2. **Means of combinations** - ways to combine elements
3. **Means of abstraction** - ways to create abstractions

## 🚀 Progress

- [x] HTDP - Preface
- [x] SICP - Building Abstractions with Procedures (Chapter 1)
- [ ] Exercises and practice problems

## 📝 Notes

All notes are written in Indonesian for easier understanding and personal reflection. In the future maybe I will translate this into English.

*"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."* - Martin Fowler

*"In the era of LLMs and coding agents, learning languages and frameworks is no longer the primary goal.
The real focus shifts to higher-level abstractions: problem framing, system design, constraints, and verification.
Languages and frameworks remain important, but mainly as execution mediums rather than core skills."* - Alam Asy'arie
